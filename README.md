# Breast-Cancer-Detection-with-AI
#Testing Machine Learning Models for the classification of Breast Cancer Dataset

This assignment attempts to address the classification of breast tissue mass image data using different machine learning techniques. The data comprises of features (real value Mean, Standard error and "worst" or largest value) derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirations of a breast tissue mass, including measurements related to radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension computed for each cell nucleus.

- The objective is to develop a model for accurately distinguishing between malignant (M) and benign (B) cases.
